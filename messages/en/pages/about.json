As soon as the FAO publishes the trading data for 2022, this chart can be updated.</p><p>The indicator used to estimate the salmon consumption of each country is apparent consumption, estimated as the difference between incoming flows (capture + farming + imports) and outgoing flows (exports + re-exports).</p><p>The conversion factor (CF) describes the ratio between the product weight and the fresh salmon weight needed to produce it. Capture and aquaculture data are provided in live weight (tonnes live weight - TLW), while trade data are provided in product weight (tonnes product weight - TPW). The transformation of products can indeed involve changes in product weight, which must be considered for balance estimates. Thus, a product with a CF of 2 means that 2 kilograms of fresh salmon are needed to produce 1 kilogram of product.</p><p>To compare produced, imported, and exported quantities, the following conversion table was considered, inspired by <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/general-concepts/conversionfactors/\">conversion tables proposed by the FAO</a>:<ul><li><strong>Salmon processed form</strong>:<ul><li>Salmons fresh or chilled: CF=1.13</li><li>Salmon steaks or meat: CF=1.6</li><li>Salmon filets: CF=2</li><li>Live salmons: CF=1</li></ul></li><li><strong>Preparation</strong>:<ul><li>Prepared or preserved: CF=1.2</li><li>Salted: CF=1.5</li><li>Dried: CF=1.62</li><li>Smoked: CF=1.92</li></ul><p>In the case where the product combines a processed form and a preparation, the conversion factors are multiplied (for example, smoked salmon fillets have a CF=2x1.92=3.84).</p><p>To obtain a simpler comparison reference between countries, per capita apparent consumption is calculated using <a href=\"https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\">population data published by the United Nations</a>.</p><p>The data presented in this chart corresponds to the Top 15 for the year 2021.

Indeed, since 2006, the Soy Moratorium is supposed to protect the Amazon from legal deforestation for soybean cultivation.
