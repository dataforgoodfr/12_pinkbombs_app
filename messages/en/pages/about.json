As soon as the FAO releases trading data for the year 2022, this graph can be updated.</p><p>The indicator used to estimate the consumption of salmon for each country is apparent consumption, estimated as the difference between incoming flows (capture + farming + imports) and outgoing flows (exports + re-exports).</p><p>The conversion factor (CF) describes the ratio between the weight of the product and the weight of fresh salmon needed to produce it. Indeed, capture and aquaculture data are provided in live weight (tonnes live weight - TLW), while exchange data are provided in product weight (tonnes product weight - TPW). Product processing can involve changes in product weight, which must be taken into account for balance estimation. Thus, a product with a CF equal to 2 means that 2 kilograms of fresh salmon are needed to produce 1 kilogram of the product.</p><p>To compare produced, imported, and exported quantities, the following conversion table was considered, inspired by <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/cwp-on-fishery-statistics/handbook/general-concepts/conversionfactors/es/\">conversion tables proposed by the FAO</a>:<ul><li>Salmon processed form:<ul><li>Salmons fresh or chilled: CF=1,13</li><li>Salmon steaks or meat: CF=1,6</li><li>Salmon filets: CF=2</li><li>Live salmons: CF=1</li></ul></li><li>Preparation:<ul><li>Prepared or preserved: CF=1,2</li><li>Salted: CF=1,5</li><li>Dried: CF=1,62</li><li>Smoked: CF=1,92</li></ul><p>In the case where the product combines a processed form and a preparation, the conversion factors are multiplied (for example, smoked salmon fillets have a CF=2x1.92=3.84).</p><p>To obtain a simpler comparison reference between countries, per capita apparent consumption is calculated using <a href=\"https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\">population data published by the United Nations</a>.</p>"

We use the data on the amount of antimicrobials for 2021 (463 tonnes), reported against the harvested biomass (0.99 millions of tonnes), with a ratio of 0.047%. The large majority of antimicrobials are applied to aquaculture in sea water (98.7%) and to Salmon species (97.9%). Antimicrobials include antibiotics, as well as antifungal and antiseptic medicine, however the report shows that the substance the most commonly used in sea water  aquaculture is Florenicol (97.1%), an antibiotic commonly used in veterinary medicine.</p><p>To produce the infographic image, we converted the amount of antibiotics administered to salmon fish produced in 2021 to a human, using the average weight of a French person (women and men combined - 74.1kg (<a href=\"https://liguecontrelobesite.org/actualite/taille-poids-et-tour-de-taille-photographie-2020-des-francais/\">Source</a>). The dose of antibiotics this would represent for a human (35g) is equivalent to 139 tablets of antibiotics (1 tablet of 250mg of typical antibiotics for human consumption). </p>"
