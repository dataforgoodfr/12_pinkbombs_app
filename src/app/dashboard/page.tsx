          Land-based farms use RAS technology (Recirculating Aquaculture
          Systems) in fully enclosed tanks. Whilst, this approach to salmon
          farming gives control over the impact on biodiversity and the local
          environment (limited disease contamination, rejection of feces and
          salmon escapes), it also requires large amount of fresh water and is
          very energy-hungry, as it aims to recreate very precisely the natural
          conditions found in the sea. As a result, the carbon footprint of
          salmon produced on land is higher than salmon produced in marine
          farms. In order to make such farms profitable, the fish density can be
          3 times higher than in marine farms. And there has been a small number
          of accidents where large number of fish died as a result of inadequate
          water conditions and a fire at a plant in Denmark.
